# Shopping-App-Redux

## Description

My motivation for this project was to convert an already existing app from using Context API, to using Redux. This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of Redux and why it is better suited for larger applications. During this project, I learned that refactoring existing code is a valuable skill that is very common in the workplace.
